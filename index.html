          What is Ignition?
        </h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
          Ignition is a virtual driving instructor that allows learner drivers to get more experience behind the wheel in scenarios they will likely face on the road, such as parallel parking, following directions, and dealing with traffic. The ability to practice these skills between lessons aims to give more learning opportunities to those drivers who cannot afford more lessons, or even a car of their own. With an emphasis on minimalist design and realistic physics, Ignition is able to simulate real world scenarios with ease on low power devices running Android, Windows, Mac, or iOS*. Virtual reality support has also been developed so that those with compatible headsets** can put themselves in the drivers seat for an extra layer of immersion.

          Why does Ignition exist?
        </h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
          Ignition is a first of its kind mobile driving simulator, that was developed as my final year project while studying Computer Science at the University of Warwick. Over the course of 6 months, Ignition was developed as a showcase of my skills in 3D modelling, physics simulations, artificial intelligence, graphical and physical optimisations, user interface and experience design, and project management, many of which I had never attempted in prior learning. <b>The project recieved the award for Best Computer Science Project at the University of Warwick in 2020</b>.

          What is the future of Ignition?
        </h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
          While the project has wrapped, I still hope to update Ignition in the future with extra features that were cut from the original plan. Although I will soon be working full time, this project is my proudest achievement from my time at University, and one which I do not intend to ignore. To that end, I have chosen to release the work completed in its current state, and any future updates will be reflected in the changelog below.
